    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team)

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux';
    
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team)
    // it goes back to the reference, players. If we update an array, we reference back.
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice() // returns a copy array when nothing is passed
    // one way
    team2[3] = 'Lux'
    console.log(team2)
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const teams3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // console.log(captain, person)
    // captain.number = 99;
    // console.log(captain, person) => number 99 has been assigned to person && captain
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log('person and cap: ', person, cap2)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    console.log('cap3 = ', cap3)
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',

      social: {

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes)

    // however there's a problem: 
    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman'
    console.log(dev.social, wes.social)
    // ohhh noooo wes.social has been updated to, because it's a shallow clone
    // we'd have to cloneDeep, but do we need to? We could just use a class...
    // however we could also... not always applicable lol
